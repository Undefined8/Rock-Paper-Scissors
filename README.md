2 players bet the same amount of Ethereum into a prize pool and play Rock Paper Scissors. Winner gets the prize pool.

## Rock Paper Scissors

Each player chooses one of three options, Rock, Paper, or Scissors, without showing their opponent their decision. Once both players picked one they will reveal their chosen option at the same time. The following rules play out:

- Rock wins over Scissors
- Scissors wins over Paper
- Paper wins over Rock
- Identical options are a tie

If a tie occurs no winner is determined and a rematch occurs.

## Matchmaking

Before a player starts a game they first choose one of three fixed quantities of Ethereum they are willing to wager after that they will be matched against someone who betted the same amount.
